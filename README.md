# Mondrian-Art
Mondrian art refers to the abstract geometric paintings created by Dutch artist Piet Mondrian between the 1920s and 1940s. These paintings often feature bold lines and geometric shapes, arranged within a square or rectangular composition, and typically use primary colors (red, blue, and yellow) along with black and white.
